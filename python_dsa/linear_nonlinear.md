# Linear Data Structure: 
* Data structure where data elements are arranged sequentially or linearly where each and every element is attached to its previous and next adjacent is called a linear data structure. 
* In linear data structure, single level is involved. Therefore, we can traverse all the elements in single run only. 
* Linear data structures are easy to implement because computer memory is arranged in a linear way. Its examples are array, stack, queue, linked list, etc. 

- Arrays
- Stack
- Queue
- Linked List

# Non-linear Data Structure: 
* Data structures where data elements are not arranged sequentially or linearly are called non-linear data structures. 
* In a non-linear data structure, single level is not involved. Therefore, we canâ€™t traverse all the elements in single run only. 
* Non-linear data structures are not easy to implement in comparison to linear data structure. 
* It utilizes computer memory efficiently in comparison to a linear data structure. Its examples are trees and graphs.  

- Graphs
- Trees

NOTE: Hash Tables can be implemented as linear or non-linear data structures. The data structures consist of key-value pairs.


# Linear VS Non-linear

1.  
**Linear**:
In a linear data structure, memory is not utilized in an efficient way.
**Non-linear**:
While in a non-linear data structure, memory is utilized in an efficient way. 

2. 
**Linear**:
Applications of linear data structures are mainly in application software development.
**Non-linear**: 
Applications of non-linear data structures are in Artificial Intelligence and image processing.

3. 
**Linear**:
Performance is usually good for simple operations like adding or removing at the ends, but slower for operations like searching or removing elements in the middle.
**Non-linear**:
Performance can vary depending on the structure and the operation, but can be optimized for specific operations.

4. 
**Linear**:
In a linear data structure, memory is not utilized in an efficient way.
**Non-linear**:
While in a non-linear data structure, memory is utilized in an efficient way.
