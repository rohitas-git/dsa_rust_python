# Applications of Hashing

# Hashing provides constant time search, insert and delete operations on average. 
# This is why hashing is one of the most used data structure, 
# example problems are, distinct elements, counting frequencies of items, finding duplicates, etc. 

# There are many other applications of hashing, including modern day cryptography hash functions. 
# Some of these applications are listed below: 

# Dictionaries
# Database Indexing
# Cryptography
# Caches
# Symbol tables in compilers/interpreters
# Routers
# Getting data from databases
# Many more ++

# Message Digest
# Password Verification
# Data Structures(Programming Languages)
# Compiler Operation
# Rabin-Karp Algorithm
# Linking File name and path together
# Game Boards
# Graphics
