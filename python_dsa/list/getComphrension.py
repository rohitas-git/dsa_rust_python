# Comphrension 
# Shortcut syntax to create a list from another iterable

# Comprehensions in Python provide us with a short and concise way to construct new sequences 
# (such as lists, set, dictionary etc.) using sequences which have been already defined. 

# Python supports the following 4 types of comprehensions:
# List Comprehensions
# Dictionary Comprehensions
# Set Comprehensions
# Generator Comprehensions

# List Comprehensions:
# output_list = [output_exp for var in input_list if (var satisfies this condition)]

# Dictionary Comprehensions:
# output_dict = {key:value for (key, value) in iterable if (key, value satisfy this condition)}

# Set Comprehensions:
# pretty similar to list comprehensions.
# The only difference between them is that set comprehensions use curly brackets { }.

# Generator Comprehensions:
# Generator Comprehensions are very similar to list comprehensions. 
# One difference between them is that generator comprehensions use circular brackets 
# whereas list comprehensions use square brackets. 
# The major difference between them is that generators donâ€™t allocate memory for the whole list. 
# Instead, they generate each value one by one which is why they are memory efficient.

# iterable - Range, list, dict, set, tuple
