# Using Memory 

There is warehouse full of boxes. Each box is 1 byte of memory.

I have to option choices when I want to use boxes:
1. I can use boxes are continuous to fill my stuff. 
2. I can use some random boxes from warehouse but then boxes I use will scattered and not continguous in space.
3. Mixed choice. Some are continous and other are scattered. That is combination of above. 

Contingous in Memory => Array / Dynamic Array 
Scattered in Memory => Linked List 
Mixed Choice -> Chained HashTable, Trie

Linked List -> Graphs / Stacks / Queues
