#! Application of Recursion

# 1. Many algorithm techniques based on recursion
#   - Dynamic Programming
#   - Backtracking
#   - Divide and Conquer (binarySearch, quickSort, mergeSort)

# 2. Many problems which are inherently recursive in nature
#   - Tower of Hanoi
#   - DFS based traversals 

# Iteration and Recursive have same expressive power
# But in many recursion is much simpler than iteration ( as mentioned in application section) 

# !Disadvantage:
#   - Iterative code causes less overhead
    # In many recursive solutions, space is O(N or logN) whereas in iterative, it's O(1) space
#   - There is also function call overhead in recursion

# But recursion is still used in problems 
# because the resultant code is very simple as opposed to case when iteration is used

#! Need of Recursion

# Recursion is an amazing technique with the help of which 
# we can reduce the length of our code and make it easier to read and write. 
# It has certain advantages over the iteration technique which will be discussed later. 
# A task that can be defined with its similar subtask, recursion is one of the best solutions for it.
