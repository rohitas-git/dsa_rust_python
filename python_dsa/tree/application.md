# TREE data structure

- To represent hierarchical data
    - Organization structure
    - Folder structure
    - XML / HTML content (JSON objects)
    - In OOP (inheritance)
    
- Binary Search Tree

- Binary Heap

- B and B+ Trees in DBMS for indexing (another choice is hashing)

- In computer networks, we have spanning and shortest path trees
    - Bridges: Use spanning tree to forward the packets
    - Routers: Use shortest path tree 

- Parse Trees, Expression Tree in Compilers

## Variants of tree:
- Trie
- Suffix tree
- Binary index tree
- Segment tree
