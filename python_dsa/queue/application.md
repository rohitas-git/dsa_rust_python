# Application

* Single resource and multiple consumers
* Synchronization between slow and fast devices
* In operation system (FCFS Scheduling, Semaphores, Spooling, Buffers for devices like keyboard )
* In computer networks, (Routers/Switches and Mail queues)
* Variations: Deque, Priority Queue and Doubly-ended Priority Queue

### Useful Applications of Queue
When a resource is shared among multiple consumers. Examples include CPU scheduling, Disk Scheduling. 
When data is transferred asynchronously (data not necessarily received at the same rate as sent) between two processes. Examples include IO Buffers, pipes, etc. 


### Applications of Queue in Operating systems:
Semaphores
FCFS ( first come first serve) scheduling, example: FIFO queue
Spooling in printers
Buffer for devices like keyboard

### Applications of Queue in Networks:
Queues in routers/ switches 
Mail Queues
Variations: ( Deque, Priority Queue, Doubly Ended Priority Queue )

### Some other applications of Queue:
Applied as waiting lists for a single shared resource like CPU, Disk, and Printer.
Applied as buffers on MP3 players and portable CD players.
Applied on Operating system to handle the interruption.
Applied to add song at the end or to play from the front.
Applied on WhatsApp when we send messages to our friends and they donâ€™t have an internet connection then these messages are queued on the server of WhatsApp.
