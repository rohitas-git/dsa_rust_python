# Applications of linked list in computer science:
* Implementation of stacks and queues
* Implementation of graphs: Adjacency list representation of graphs is the most popular which uses a linked list to store adjacent vertices.
* Dynamic memory allocation: We use a linked list of free blocks.
* Maintaining a directory of names
* Performing arithmetic operations on long integers
* Manipulation of polynomials by storing constants in the node of the linked list 
* representing sparse matrices

# Applications of linked list in the real world:
* Image viewer – Previous and next images are linked and can be accessed by the next and previous buttons.
* Previous and next page in a web browser – We can access the previous and next URL searched in a web browser by pressing the back and next buttons since they are linked as a linked list.
* Music Player – Songs in the music player are linked to the previous and next songs. So you can play songs either from starting or ending of the list.
