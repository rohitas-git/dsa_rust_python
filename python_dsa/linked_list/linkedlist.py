# Linked List

# - Ordered Linear data structure 
# - List of connected memory fragments (node)
# - No random access and cache friendliness 
#   due to fragmented memory (elements not arranged in contiguous memory)
# - Allows flexible insertion and deletion of memory fragments 
#   just by changing the memory connections [worst case- O(1)]
