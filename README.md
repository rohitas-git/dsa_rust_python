# Data Structure and Algorithms

This is for the purpose of learning DSA and practice by solving a variety of related problems.

Problems/Topics covered:
- Patterns based problems to flex the Programmatic thinking skill.
- Basic Maths problems 
- Recursion 
- Sort
- Search
- Array / List
- 

I have solved DSA problems both in Rust and Python.
There may be some that solved in only either of them. I solved very few of them in Golang.

I have explained the data structures and interesting algorithms in the comments of rust and python files.

It all started for my personal practice. So there maybe lack of uniformity of explaination in either Rust or Python solved problem code. 

I have grown a lot while solving problems. Intially, I solved problems in Rust and tested using main.rs.<br> 
But now, I have grown to write test case to test the algorithms and solution to problems.<br>
I started using features to conditionally compile only the modules on which I am working. 
I have also written more standard style code in Rust.

I prefer to solve problems in Rust as its my prefered language. 
Python is used when I need to practice or view them written in a simpler code.
