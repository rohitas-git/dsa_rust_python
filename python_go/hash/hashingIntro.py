# Hashing

# Mainly used to implement dictionary
# Hashing technqiue is used to create HashTables
# Also used to impl sets

# Search, Insert, Delete operations in => O(1) on average

# Unsorted Array:
# - Delete, Insert - O(1)
# - Search - O(N)

# Sorted Array
# - Search - O(logN)
# - Insert, Delete - O(N)

# Binary Search Tree (BST) like AVL and red-black tree
# - O(logN) for search, insert, delete

# Hash beats everyone in Search, Insert, Delete operations

# However, it doesn't provide efficient means for some operations 
# that are present in other data structures 
# Not useful for :
# - Finding closest value   [AVL or Red-black tree]
# - Sorted data     [AVL or Red-black tree]
# - Prefix searching    [Trie]
